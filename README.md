# GameDev Test

This project was part of a game test job application and is here for archival purposes.

The game is a simple platformer were the player character runs forward, dropping down from plataform to platform, sometimes riding metal pipes in order to not fall and reach the end of the level, collecting coins and finding "secret" paths by the way.
